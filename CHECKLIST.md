## 2. Firebase Storage Integration
- **Description:** Uploaded videos are stored in Firebase Storage.

### âœ… Notes
- All features are implemented in React functional components with Hooks.

- Core CSS is used for styling; no Tailwind or external frameworks are required.
- Progress and transcription states are fully reactive with smooth UI updates.
